:mortar_board: School project : create a webpage for the Apple Homepod

---------------------------------------------------


 ###### Project objectives : 
- Present the HomePod in detail and emphasize the technological revolution brought by the product.

- Highlight the contribution that the product creates in the Apple ecosystem (computer, smartphone, connected watch)

- Encourage visitors to buy the product


---------------------------------------------------

###### Our mission : 
1. Create a new website. This site will have to meet the new objectives defined by the strategy. For reasons of graphic coherence, the site's charter will be a variation of the one existing on the apple.com/en site (colors, typography...).

2. Encourage Internet users to come and visit the new website, create the animation on the site.

3. Set up a carousel on the site.

4. Propose marketing ideas to encourage visitors to order on the website.
